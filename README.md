# neuroglancer-url-tools
Typescript objects for synthesizing URLs for the neuroglancer visualization tool. 

# About
[Neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer) is an excellent browser-based visualization tool for volumetric images that uses URLs for encoding the state of the viewer. This package offers lightweight datastructures and tools for creating these URLs. Specifically, this package incompletely implements the viewer state => URL pipeline which exists in the neuroglancer typescript and python codebases.
